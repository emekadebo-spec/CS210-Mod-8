Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    The purpose of the project was to develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time, including an output for the year end balance and the year end earned interest.
What did you do particularly well?
    I was able to structure the code well and I was able to do it in a minimal amount of code in the int main() section.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I could have added an output in regards to a failure for entering a number that wouldn't have computed, such as a negative.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I always had a struggle with figuring out for loops, as well as calling defined functions. But this project helped me overcome that by essentially constantly doing practice on the side with an online compiler.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    The use of loops will be exceptionally useful in the future due to the fact that they will allow me to make a lot more outputs with minimal code.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I stuck to what I couldn't understand in an effort to learn it. I refrained from using too many things I had just recently learned and decided to mainly use for loops and iomanip to achieve the result. I needed.
